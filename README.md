# anonymous-blog

Practice project for MongoDB, ExpressJS and OAuth. This is a project based on an assignment in The Odin Project.

This project serves to imitate a social media web app where users can login to create posts, comment on posts, and reply to comments. All posts are public.

Users can apply to become Premium members and/or Admins. Premium members are able to see each user's real name, and Admins have the power to delete posts.

This project has been deployed on Railway, [here](http://anonymous-blog-production.up.railway.app).
